# ML-in-Octave
Machine learning algorithms built from scratch in Octave.
Logistic Regression: 
  -Logistic Regression being run on some data
  -finding the cost
  -minimizing the cost by russing gradient descent and getting new set of parameters for the hypothesis
  -again calculating the cost function
